# Tesla & GameStop Stock and Revenue Analysis 📈
## IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate 
### Python Project for Data Science (Course 5 of 11)
This project compares the historical stock performance and revenue trends of **Tesla (TSLA)** and **GameStop (GME)** using real-world financial data. The analysis leverages both **API-based data extraction (yfinance)** and **web scraping** techniques to visualize the connection (or lack thereof) between company fundamentals and market behavior.

## 🧠 Objective
To analyze and compare the stock prices and revenue of Tesla and GameStop over time, revealing how each company’s market valuation aligns—or diverges—from its financial performance.

## 🛠 Tools & Skills Used
* **Python**
  * `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `yfinance`, `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`
* Data collection via:
  * **yfinance API** (for stock prices)
  * **Web scraping** (for revenue data from financial websites)
* Data cleaning & merging
* Time series visualization
* Skills Network Labs Jupyter environment

## 📁 Files in this repository
* `IBMC5_TSLA&GME Stock Analysis_python assignment.ipynb` : Python script containing the complete analysis, from data collection to visualization.

## 📌 Highlights
* Downloaded stock price data for TSLA and GME using `yfinance`
* Scraped revenue data for both companies from financial websites using BeautifulSoup
* Plotted dual-axis charts to illustrate revenue trends and stock price movements
* Key findings:
  * **Tesla**: Stock growth mostly aligned with increasing revenue, especially post-2019
  * **GameStop**: 2021 stock spike not correlated with revenue—driven largely by speculative trading activity

## 📝 Notes
* This analysis was completed as part of the [IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate]([https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-analyst]).
* All data is publicly available and used for educational purposes only.
* Stock data sourced from Yahoo Finance via the `yfinance` Python library.
* Revenue data obtained through scraping financial report pages provided in the activity.
